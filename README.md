Biome Bundle v6 Changelog

    Raised sea level to Y63 to improve mod compatibility and create more space underground (integrated all of SamGungraven's changes)
    Ore generation is now vanilla, with the exception of emeralds which have a small chance to appear in any biome
    Made volatility values more similar between biomes to improve terrain smoothing between biomes
    Changed global 'fracture' settings to prevent overhanging terrain and create more realistic landscapes
    Tweaked ocean and continent sizes so huge oceans are created less often
    Overhauled ice biome group
    Re-enabled vanilla ocean monuments
    Fixed cut-off structures (Issue 77) https://github.com/BiomeBundle/BiomeBundle/issues/77
    Fixed double entries: https://github.com/BiomeBundle/BiomeBundle/issues/83
    Re-enabled biomes https://github.com/BiomeBundle/BiomeBundle/issues/84
    Created a few new biomes using new trees, rocks, etc. Also added a few new flatter variants of existing biomes to create easier to traverse variations.
    Rebalanced the rarity of all structures to make variation more likely and to make rarer structures like the custom mansions slightly more likely to spawn
    Fix for books not correctly enchanted in loot chests
    Fixed uppercase/lowercase file name issues that affected linux environments
    Fixed incorrect data in flower pots generated in structures
    Reviewed mob spawners, some structures had them too closely together making it to easy to create mob farms
    Added a couple more structure variants added to existing structure lists
    Lots of small enhancements to existing biomes
    Note: This version is not compatible with worlds made with previous versions of Biome Bundle. Biomes have been added/removed and so seeds no longer generate the same layout. Starting a brand new world is recommended.
